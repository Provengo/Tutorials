|===
| Tutorial | Description | Topics | owner/status

| Working with Provengo - Overview
| Intro to model-based-testing and to operating the Provengo tool. Mainly philosophy, what commands at what stage, where do the DSLs come in. Modeling mindset (all possible runs allowed by a spec vs. a single run that meets it)
| MBT, Basics
| @Michael

4+^| Simple E2E trail

| √ xref:tutorials/1-first-steps.adoc[First Steps]
| Technical intro to Provengo and to its base language, BP-Base. Create a project, use bp-base to generate a basic test for the morning example. 
| b-thread, event, RWB, event sets, language reference, --verbose, bp.log, visualization. Load order. Quick Do's and Don'ts in BP (reference to the page). Also mention the EventSets class, and the `interrupt` idiom. Introduce the Morning example.
| @Michael

| Simple Automation
| Get an early achievement feeling. Use `Ctrl::pause` to better debug and automate. Focus is on getting a model to operate a site, not on testing the site. Flags: `--dry`, `--show-sessions`
| automation/actuation, Selenium library, Control library, `@provengo summon <lib>`, model refinement, event sets.
| @Michael/@Sivan

| Validation and Verification
| Detect the "socks after shoes" issue. Introduce the ASSERT( false, message ). Explain the 2 meanings of "can't do X". Introduce block and rainy day checks. 
| Assertions, `Constraints` library.
| @Michael

| Creating Test Suites: `Sample` and `Ensemble`
| Generating test suites out of the morning example. Using sample and ensemble. (can use automation for running, but make this optional). Introduce project configuration and profiles to generate multiple test suites based on areas of interest. Limit ensemble function to met goals. We'll deal with complex functions later.
| profiles, ensemble, sample
| @Michael/@Sivan

| Creating Manual Tests
| Building on the "creating test suites" example, but with manual testing. Show how to create filters and tags, set script names, add various meta-data to the instructions.
| manual tests
| @Sivan?

| Creating Test Scripts
| Building on the "creating test suites" example, but now generating tests for python. Show how to set script names. Show how to include code. If we can generate good Selenium scripts - that's great.
| Manual tests
| @Sivan?

4+^| Deep Dives

| Simulated Multi Session (low priority)
| Perform a multi-session test/model on an updated version of the the morning web site. Wake up now creates a new person, and each command need to address a specific person that performs it. There's only one bathroom, so only a single person can brush their teeth at once. We can now create multiple interleavings between `n` people (tutorial deals with 2, but code is such that it can grow to any size). Brushing teeth now becomes two events (`brushStart(name)`, `brushEnd(name)`). Validate that at most a single person brushes at each point, and also add rainy day. Mention that same approach could be used with multiple browser sessions.
| Multi-session, automation, verification. 
| @Gera #new code required#

| Using Hooks
| Use testing and automation for the bank. Use scripts to start and stop the selenium server, and maybe to tweet/slack/email messages on failures.
| Automation, advanced. _Scripts can be used for the CLI tutorial as well_
| @Sivan #new code required#


4+^| General/Reference Pages

| FaQ
| Answer common questions about MBT, Provengo, tooling, "how can provengo do X" etc.
| Multiple
| Up for grabs

| Dos and Don'ts in BP
| Covers what users can and can't do in BP, but also really in BPjs and Rhino. Needs to be non-intimidating as possible.
| 
| @Achiya?

| Term Glossary
| Short explanation for all BP and Provengo terms. It should be possible to link from other pages directly to the terms (see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/).

*  [ ] Techniques
** [ ] Blocking to Focus
** [ ] Space minimization - setting to `undefined`, using `interrupt`. Can use the snooze sample from the morning routine ( do-while loop with maybe() at the condition, bthread that limits snooze count with interrupt on the wakeup. No interrupt should cause a tree form). Also - CPS style (take from dev-tech-demos).
