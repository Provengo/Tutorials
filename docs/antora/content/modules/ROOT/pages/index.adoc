The Provengo tool helps organizations that develop software systems. It improves communication between business, development, and QA teams, and improved product quality. This is done by making system requirements active - they can be validated, visualized, and imposed on the developed system using auto-generated, optimized test suites.

The tutorials in this site will teach you how to use the Provengo tool to its full extent, helping you in your day-to-day specification and QA work.

NOTE: This is a tutorials site for Provengo's commandline tool. For the reference documentation site, please visit https://docs.provengo.tech[provengo.tech].
