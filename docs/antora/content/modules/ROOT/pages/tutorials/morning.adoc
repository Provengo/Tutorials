In this short tutorial we`ll present you to {link-morning-website}[Provengo's Morning Routine] website. 
This is an example that simulates the process of a person's morning routine. 

====
When completing this tutorial you'll know::
    What is the Morning Routine Simulator and how it works. 
    

This is useful because::
    In later tutorials you will use this website to create a model that includes an automation layer. 
    

====

## Overview

The website includes a drwing of a person and menu of `Actions` the person can perform on their morning routine:

. Wake Up 
. Wear: shoes, pants,shirt, socks 
. Eat: cereal, banana
. Brush Teeth
. Go Out

When clicking on one of these buttons you will see something changes in the drawing. 

for example, if you click on the Wake Up button, you can see that the persons eyes are now open.

You can add your own action-buttons in the `new actions panel`.

In addition, You can find a chat box to the right of the person. 
When clicking on any button, including the ones you have added, You will also see a text that confirms the selected action is performed.

Each button has an id you can use the x-path to locate it. 

We'll be modeling the morning routine as a process we want to test. Then we will create the automation-tests on this website so we can get a sense of how the provengo system works. 

For example, a person's morning routine can include the following: wake up, brush teeth, get dressed, go out. 
There are many things to test in this process; make sure the person is awake, make sure they wear their cloths in the correct order (they can not wear socks over their shoes), don't forget to brush teeth. 

a different person can have his morning routine also include having a breakfast and tiding up.. 

The morning routine is the process you want to model, then using the provengo tool, you use this model to generate some tests. You can decide your own flow, or your own requirements. 


## What's Next?
- Continue playing with the _Morning Routine_ app. Get comfortable with it. And when you feel ready, jump right into the next tutorial to see how to use the provengo tool to test the app.
