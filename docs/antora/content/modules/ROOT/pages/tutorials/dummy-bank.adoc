In this short tutorial we`ll present you to our https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[Dummy-Bank website]. 
This is an example based on the real world, which simulates the process of scheduling an appointment at the bank. 

IMPORTANT: _Provengo Dummy Bank_ is not a real bank. It is a part of the _Provengo tutorials sites_ and is used to demonstrate a common use-case of the Provengo tool.
